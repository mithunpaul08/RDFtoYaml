# RDFtoYaml

- ask marco/becky
    - appliedTo is only appliedToLeaf. we will have to find the parent of it. is that ok?
    eg: search for http://webprotege.stanford.edu/R95cAeNa2Y3RUZKt6oWjAPg. the leaf Nea9e408b452e4f749e3ec03e75d87721 doesn't have a text value.
    - but http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#someValuesFrom has a value, i.e services.
